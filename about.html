      <p>Welcome to my portfolio website! I'm Kartikey Saxena, a passionate Computer Engineering student with a strong focus on software development and web development. Currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology degree at Delhi Technological University, I am eager to explore new opportunities and contribute to impactful projects.</p>
      <p>With a love for coding and problem-solving, I have dedicated my time to enhancing my skills and knowledge in various areas. From software development to web development, I am constantly seeking new challenges to grow as a professional.</p>
      <p>In my ongoing internship, I am engaged in the exciting field of Multimodal Biometrics Authentication. This experience has allowed me to delve into machine learning fundamentals, swarm intelligence, and metaheuristic swarm-based algorithms. Through hands-on experimentation and analysis, I have gained valuable insights into optimizing these algorithms using Python programming and data visualization techniques.</p>
      <p>During my academic journey, I have also completed relevant courses to expand my skill set. Courses such as "Intro to Front End Development" have provided me with a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I have honed my programming skills through courses like "Python Essential Training" and "Go Essential Training."</p>
      <p>Outside of academics and work, I enjoy exploring new technologies and keeping up with the latest trends in the software development industry. I am always eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals and contribute to the creation of innovative and user-centric software solutions.</p>
      <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me pursuing my hobbies, which include reading books on technology and entrepreneurship, playing video games, and staying active through various sports activities. These interests help me maintain a well-rounded perspective and fuel my creativity in problem-solving.</p>
